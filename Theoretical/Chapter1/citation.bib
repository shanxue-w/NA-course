abstract = {We introduce two new volume-of-fluid interface reconstruction algorithms and compare the accuracy of 
these algorithms to four other widely used volume-of-fluid interface reconstruction algorithms. We find that when 
the interface is smooth (e.g., continuous with two continuous derivatives) the new methods are second-order accurate 
and the other algorithms are first-order accurate. We propose a design criteria for a volume-of-fluid interface 
reconstruction algorithm to be second-order accurate. Namely, that it reproduce lines in two space dimensions or
 planes in three space dimensions exactly. We also introduce a second-order, unsplit, volume-of-fluid advection
  algorithm that is based on a second-order, finite difference method for scalar conservation laws due to Bell, 
  Dawson and Shubin. We test this advection algorithm by modeling several different interface shapes propagating 
  in two simple incompressible flows and compare the results with the standard second-order, operator-split 
  advection algorithm. Although both methods are second-order accurate when the interface is smooth, we find 
  that the unsplit algorithm exhibits noticeably better resolution in regions where the interface has 
  discontinuous derivatives, such as at corners.}
