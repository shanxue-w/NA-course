This is the documentation for the project. All classes and functions are documented here.\hypertarget{index_usage_sec}{}\doxysection{More Information}\label{index_usage_sec}
Every documented function has its own description and the usage of the function. You can check the documentation of the function to see how to use it.

{\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classPPoly}{PPoly}}} is the class that is used to create a piecewise polynomial. It has a constructor that takes a list of coefficients and a list of breakpoints.

{\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classBSpline}{BSpline}}} is the class that is used to create a B-\/spline.

{\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classPPInterpolate}{PPInterpolate}}} is the class that is used to interpolate a set of points using a piecewise polynomial.

{\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classBInterpolate}{BInterpolate}}} is the class that is used to interpolate a set of points using a B-\/spline.

{\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classCurve}{Curve}}} is the class that is used to curve fitting.

{\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classBallFunction}{Ball\+Function}}} is the class that is used to create a ball function.
